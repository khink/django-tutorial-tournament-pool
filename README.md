# django-tutorial-tournament-pool

A Django project letting people predict tournament results.

This is just a way of checking out [Django's tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/) and applying it to something other than Polls, Questions and Choices (or Books and Authors).


## Requirements

This project requires Django and some handy add-ons. To install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
